            <h3>Creating My First Webpage</h3>
            <p>
                Creating my first webpage was both exciting and challenging. At first, keeping track of all the tags and structural elements felt overwhelming. However, as I practiced and broke the process into smaller steps, it became much easier to understand.
                Learning how to structure an HTML document has given me a solid foundation in web development and a better appreciation for how websites are built and displayed.

            <h3>Improving Webpages</h3>
            <p>
                I now have a better idea of how to improve a webpage's look and feel since completing Lab 02. I've been learning more about the fundamentals of web design, such as sticking to a standardized layout, color palette, and font. 
                Making my webpages more user-friendly by including links and arranging the content in a more understandable manner was one of the most important things I learned. 
                Additionally, I took the effort to learn how to use external stylesheets, which helped me manage and organize my work. I'm excited to learn more about CSS and add more interactive components to my projects as I continue to improve.

            <h3>Implementing Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>
                This lab has taught me the importance of responsive design in web development. By using CSS flexbox, grid, and media queries, I was able to create a page that adapts well to both mobile and desktop screens.
                Adding internal navigation with link anchors made it easier to jump between sections, improving the overall user experience. 
                Learning about responsive design has given me a deeper understanding of accessibility and usability in web design. I now appreciate how important it is to ensure that webpages remain functional and visually appealing across different devices.

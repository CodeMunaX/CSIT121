      <h2>Reflection on the Final Project</h2>
      <p>Completing this final project was a challenging yet rewarding experience. The most difficult part for me was creating a cohesive, responsive design that worked across multiple devices and browsers. Ensuring that all pages validated properly, followed accessibility guidelines, and integrated consistent navigation took time and attention to detail. However, seeing it all come together into one unified portfolio made the hard work feel worthwhile. I’m proud of how far I’ve come with HTML and CSS since the start of the semester.</p>

      <p>Testing the site on both desktop and mobile devices revealed the importance of mobile-first design and @media queries. What looked clean on a laptop sometimes appeared cluttered on a phone, so I had to adjust font sizes, navigation, and layout accordingly. I also tested the site in Chrome and Firefox to ensure consistent rendering and functionality.</p>

      <p>Throughout this course, I’ve learned not only the technical skills to build websites from scratch using semantic HTML and modern CSS, but also how to think critically about user experience and accessibility. I now understand how important structure, hierarchy, and styling are in making websites both beautiful and functional. I’m excited to apply these skills in future web development work!</p>

    <h2>Final Project Reflections</h2>
    <p>
      Building this final portfolio was both challenging and exciting. I had to revisit every lab and make sure the design, structure, and layout felt unified across the site. Learning how to work with CSS media queries and responsive design was especially valuable, as it helped me think more deeply about user experience across devices. Getting everything to look consistent across labs — while making it all feel modern — pushed me to problem-solve creatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Testing the site on multiple browsers and devices showed me how important it is to code with flexibility in mind. Something that looked good on a desktop sometimes didn’t work right on mobile, so I learned to use flexbox, percentages, and breakpoints to adapt layouts dynamically. This taught me to be more mindful of accessibility and real-world use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this course has given me a strong foundation in web development. I now understand the structure of HTML, how CSS styles and arranges content, and how JavaScript adds interactivity. I also gained confidence in using GitHub Pages and publishing my work online. I'm leaving the semester proud of how far I’ve come — and excited to keep building.

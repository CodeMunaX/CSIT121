      <h2>What is the Battery Status API?</h2>
      <p>
        The Battery Status API is a tool that allows websites to access basic information about a device's battery. It can tell if the device is charging, how much battery is left, and how much time remains until the battery is full or empty. Developers can use this information to create websites that respond to a user's battery level. For example, a site might turn off heavy animations if it sees that the battery is low. This helps make web browsing smoother and more mindful of the user's device power.

        One of the best parts about the Battery Status API is how simple it is to use. Developers only need a few lines of code to check important battery details. This small amount of code can make a big difference for users, especially those using mobile phones or tablets. When a website knows the battery is almost dead, it can automatically adjust and reduce how much power it uses. It's a simple but powerful way to show that a site cares about user experience.

        Overall, the Battery Status API is all about making the web smarter and more responsive. It gives websites a way to "listen" to the device and act with care. Even though it provides only a few pieces of information, those pieces are very valuable. As technology grows, APIs like this help create a better balance between fun features and practical needs. The Battery Status API is a great example of how small changes can make a big difference online.

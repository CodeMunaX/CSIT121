      <h2>How is the Battery Status API Used?</h2>
      <p>
        Developers can check a user's device's battery level and charging status using the Battery Status API.  Websites can then modify their behavior based on this information.  For instance, if a video streaming website detects that the battery is really low, it may automatically reduce the video quality.  To save energy, another website may disable unnecessary features like background music or movies that play automatically.  Users who need to extend the life of their battery will benefit greatly from these minor adjustments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Battery Status API in JavaScript is relatively easy to use.  Developers use the battery object that is returned after using `navigator.getBattery()`.  This object has attributes that provide crucial information, such as charging, level, and chargingTime.  If developers want to know when the battery is charged or not, they can even listen for events like chargingchange.  Websites can become more responsive and considerate of the device condition of their users with just a few lines of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        A real-world scenario would be a mobile game that modifies the frequency of progress saves according to battery life.  It might save the game more frequently if the battery is low so that the player won't lose their progress in the event that the device goes off.  Another example may be an online store that, when a user's battery is low, turns off big advertisements and image carousels.  Giving users a more seamless, smart experience that considers their demands is the same objective in each situation.

          batteryStatus.textContent += " (Charging)";
        } else {
          batteryStatus.textContent += " (Not Charging)";
        }

        // You can also listen for changes in the battery status
        battery.addEventListener('chargingchange', function() {
          batteryStatus.textContent = `Battery Level: ${battery.level * 100}% (${battery.charging ? "Charging" : "Not Charging"})`;
        });

        battery.addEventListener('levelchange', function() {
          batteryStatus.textContent = `Battery Level: ${battery.level * 100}%`;
        });
      }).catch(function(error) {
        console.error("Battery API not supported on this device.", error);

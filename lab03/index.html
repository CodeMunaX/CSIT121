                Creating my first webpage was both exciting and challenging. At first, keeping track of all the tags and structural elements felt overwhelming. However, as I practiced and broke the process into smaller steps, it became much easier to understand.
                Learning how to structure an HTML document has given me a solid foundation in web development and a better appreciation for how websites are built and displayed.

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="important">Basic HTML Structure</li>
                <li>Using Headings, Paragraphs, and Lists</li>
                <li>Adding Hyperlinks and Email Links</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Learning about HTML structure, structured elements, and web standards has been exciting. 
                I learned a lot from:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">this page</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">and this page</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>
                I now have a better idea of how to improve a webpage's look and feel since completingÂ Lab 02. I've been learning more about the fundamentals of web design, such as sticking to a standardized layout, color palette, and font.  Making my webpages more user-friendly by include links and arranging the content in a more understandable manner was one of the most important things I learned. Additionally, I took the effort to learn how to use external stylesheets, which helped me manage and organize my work. I'm excited to learn more about CSS and add more interactive components to my projects as I continue to improve.
